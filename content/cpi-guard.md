### 1. Verify Solana/Anchor/Rust Versions

We will be interacting with the `token22` program in this lab and that requires you have solana cli version â‰¥ 1.18.0. 

To check your version run:
```bash
solana --version
```

If the version printed out after running `solana --version` is less than `1.18.0` then you can update the cli version manually. Note, at the time of writing this, you cannot simply run the `solana-install update` command. This command will not update the CLI to the correct version for us, so we have to explicitly download version `1.18.0`. You can do so with the following command:

```bash
solana-install init 1.18.0
```

If you run into this error at any point attempting to build the program, that likely means you do not have the correct version of the solana CLI installed.

```bash
anchor build
error: package `solana-program v1.18.0` cannot be built because it requires rustc 1.72.0 or newer, while the currently active rustc version is 1.68.0-dev
Either upgrade to rustc 1.72.0 or newer, or use
cargo update -p solana-program@1.18.0 --precise ver
where `ver` is the latest version of `solana-program` supporting rustc 1.68.0-dev
```

You will also want the latest version of the anchor CLI installed. You can follow along the steps listed here to update via avm https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/avm

or simply run
```bash
avm install latest
avm use latest
```

At the time of writing, the latest version of the Anchor CLI is `0.29.0`

Now, we can check our rust version.

```bash
rustc --version
```

At the time of writing, version `1.26.0` was used for the rust compiler. If you would like to update, you can do so via `rustup`
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html

```bash
rustup update
```

Now, we should have all the correct versions installed.

### 2. Get starter code and add dependencies

Let's grab the starter branch.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Unboxed-Software/token22-staking
cd token22-staking
git checkout starter
```

### 3. Update Program ID and Anchor Keypair

Once in the starter branch, run

`anchor keys list`

to get your program ID.

Copy and paste this program ID in the `Anchor.toml` file

```rust
// in Anchor.toml
[programs.localnet]
token_22_staking = "<YOUR-PROGRAM-ID-HERE>"
```

And in the `programs/token-22-staking/src/lib.rs` file.

```rust
declare_id!("<YOUR-PROGRAM-ID-HERE>");
```

Lastly set your developer keypair path in `Anchor.toml`.

```toml
[provider]
cluster = "Localnet"
wallet = "/YOUR/PATH/HERE/id.json"
```

If you don't know what your current keypair path is you can always run the solana cli to find out.

```bash
solana config get
```

### 4. Confirm the program builds

Let's build the starter code to confirm we have everything configured correctly. If it does not build, please revisit the steps above.

```bash
anchor build
```

You can safely ignore the warnings of the build script, these will go away as we add in the necessary code.

Feel free to run the provided tests to make sure the rest of the dev environment is setup correct. You'll have to install the node dependancies using `npm` or `yarn`. The tests should run, but they'll all fail until we have completed our program.

```bash
yarn install
anchor test
```
